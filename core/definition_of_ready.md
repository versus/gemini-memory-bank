# Definition of Ready

A task is considered "Ready" to be worked on only if it meets the following criteria:

1.  **Clear & Actionable Title**: The task description is unambiguous.
    - *Bad*: "Fix bug"
    - *Good*: "Fix login button not working on Safari"
2.  **Acceptance Criteria Defined**: There is a clear list of what success looks like.
    - *Example*: "1. User clicks login. 2. API call is made. 3. User is redirected to dashboard."
3.  **Dependencies Identified**: Any other tasks that must be completed first are known.

*Before starting a task, I will verify it meets these criteria. If not, I will switch to **Planning Mode** to clarify them with you.*
