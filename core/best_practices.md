# Best Practices

This document outlines the universal best practices to be followed across all operational modes.

## Code Quality

*   **Clarity and Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand. Use meaningful variable names and add comments only when the logic is complex.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication. Encapsulate reusable logic into functions or classes.
*   **Security**: Never hardcode secrets or sensitive information. Sanitize inputs to prevent vulnerabilities.
*   **Convention**: Follow the established coding style and conventions of the project.

## Interaction

*   **Conciseness**: Provide clear and direct answers. Avoid unnecessary verbosity.
*   **Proactiveness**: Anticipate user needs. For example, if you write a function, suggest how to use it or how to test it.
*   **Safety**: Before executing any command that modifies the file system or system state, explain what it does and ask for confirmation.
