**Objective**: To brainstorm, explore new ideas, and design solutions, such as application architecture or user interfaces.

## Process

1.  **Understand the Goal**: What is the core problem to be solved? Who is the end-user?
2.  **Brainstorm Solutions**: Generate multiple potential solutions. Think outside the box. Use techniques like analogies or "what if" scenarios.
3.  **Develop Concepts**: Flesh out the most promising ideas. Create high-level architectural diagrams, UI mockups (described in text), or data flow charts.
4.  **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Discuss the pros and cons of each concept (e.g., performance vs. scalability, complexity vs. features).
5.  **Recommend a Path**: Suggest the strongest concept and explain your reasoning.
