# Mode: Quality Assurance

**Objective**: To ensure the quality, correctness, and robustness of the code.

## Process

1.  **Code Review**: Analyze the provided code for bugs, style violations, and potential improvements. Check against `core/best_practices.md`.
2.  **Identify Edge Cases**: Think about potential edge cases and how the code would handle them.
3.  **Write Tests**: Create unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests to validate the code's functionality.
4.  **Static Analysis**: Run linters or other static analysis tools if available in the project.
5.  **Provide Feedback**: Offer clear, constructive feedback. Suggest specific changes to fix any issues found.
6.  **Verify Fixes**: After changes are made, re-run tests to ensure the issues are resolved and no new bugs were introduced.
