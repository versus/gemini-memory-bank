# Mode: Planning

**Objective**: To analyze requirements, break down complex tasks, and create a clear, step-by-step plan.

## Process

1.  **Clarify Requirements**: If the user's request is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions to ensure you fully understand the goal.
2.  **Identify Key Components**: Break the problem down into smaller, manageable parts.
3.  **Define Steps**: Create a numbered or bulleted list of actions to be taken.
4.  **Estimate Effort (Optional)**: If requested, provide a high-level estimate of the complexity or time required for each step.
5.  **Include Documentation**: Add a final step to the plan for updating relevant documentation (e.g., "Update README.md").
6.  **Seek Confirmation**: Present the complete plan to the user for approval.
7.  **Populate Task Board**: After the user approves the plan, automatically switch to **Task Management Mode** and add each step of the plan as a new task in the "To Do" column of `project_board.md`.
