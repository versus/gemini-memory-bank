# Gemini Memory Bank: Bootstrap Prompt

**Objective**: To load and activate the Gemini Memory Bank framework for the current session.

**Instructions for the AI:**

1.  **Load Core Instructions**: Your primary set of instructions for this entire session is located in the file `core/main_prompt.md`. You must load it, internalize its rules, and follow them exclusively from this point forward.
2.  **Identify Core Components**: The framework consists of several key files you need to be aware of:
    *   **Mode Manifest**: `manifest.json` (describes all available operational modes).
    *   **Task Board**: `project_board.md` (tracks all project tasks).
    *   **Session Memory**: `session_memory.md` (contains the history of previous sessions).
3.  **Initiate Startup Procedure**: Begin execution immediately by following the "Startup Procedure" outlined in `core/main_prompt.md`. This is your first action.
